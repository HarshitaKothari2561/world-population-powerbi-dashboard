World Population Dynamics Dashboard
Power BI Data Scraping Portfolio Project  

This project offers an in-depth analysis of world population dynamics, examining data by continents and countries. The data was scraped directly from the web using Power BI's Web Connector and then cleaned and transformed in Power Query. The findings are presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends in global population.

The data was scraped from the following websites:
- World Population by Country: [Worldometers]
(https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/)
- Countries by Continent: [World Population Review]
(https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/list-of-countries-by-continent)
- World Capital Cities: [Geography Fieldwork]
(https://geographyfieldwork.com/WorldCapitalCities.htm)

 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs):
- Total world population
- Yearly population change
- Median age
- Population distribution by continent

 1. Population Distribution by Continent:
   - Chart Type: Line chart  
   - Insight: This chart provides a visual representation of the population across different continents, highlighting which continents have the largest populations.

 2. Population by Country:
   - Chart Type: Tree map  
   - Insight: A treemap that illustrates the population of each country and its share of the global population, making it easy to compare countries within their continents.

 3. Median Age Distribution:
   - Chart Type: Donut chart  
   - Insight: This chart showcases the distribution of the median age across different continents, offering insights into the age demographics worldwide.

4. Migrants Impact on Population:
   - Chart Type: Bar chart  
   - Insight: This chart compares the net migration effect on population growth, providing an understanding of how migration influences population dynamics across different continents.

5. Geographical Visualization:
   - Chart Type: Map  
   - Insight: A world map that visualizes population data by country, offering a geographical perspective on population density and distribution.

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of how to leverage Power BI's capabilities in data scraping, transformation, and visualization to generate actionable insights from publicly available data.
